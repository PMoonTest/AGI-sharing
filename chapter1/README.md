In this quickstart we'll show you how to build a simple LLM application with LangChain. This application will translate text from English into another language. This is a relatively simple LLM application - it's just a single LLM call plus some prompting. Still, this is a great way to get started with LangChain - a lot of features can be built with just some prompting and an LLM call!

After reading this tutorial, you'll have a high level overview of:

Using language models

Using PromptTemplates and OutputParsers

Using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) to chain components together

Debugging and tracing your application using LangSmith

Deploying your application with LangServe
